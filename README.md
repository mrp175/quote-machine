# A simple quote machine. 

This project is deployed [here](https://mrp175.github.io/quote-machine/) so feel free to check it out.

Made using react and typescript, the app will display a new random quote at set intervals, or on user input. The transitions are animated, fading in and out the quotes, as well as changing the hue of the background and text.
